					<p>How git workflow works when collaborating in a group on GitHub, each person gets their own branch instead of everyone on the master branch so that it doesn't make errors when we merge our work. To create a branch you do "git checkout -b branch_name" with this you made a branch but not really it didn't git push the branch yet. Then you do "git add -u" with this you add modified code and the deleted code. Then "git commit -m origin branch_name" you've now commited the code and its ready to push, the final code is "git push -u origin branch_name" you've now made the branch and is seperately made. now you created a branch and now can work on it.</p>
