Then you do "git add -u" with this you add modified code and the deleted code. Then "git commit -m origin branch_name" you've now commited the code and its ready to push, the final code is "git push -u origin branch_name" you've now made the branch and is seperately made. now you created a branch and now can work on it.</p>
